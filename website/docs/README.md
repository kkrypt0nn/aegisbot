# Aegisbot

Aegisbot is a novel Discord and Twitch bot with **advanced pattern-matching auto-moderation**, built on concepts inspired by [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/) - not just yet another "auto-mod" clone.

It allows for fine-grained detection of malicious, spammy, or unwanted behavior using customizable matching rules written in a simple and common syntax such as YAML or JSON, rather than static keyword lists or simplistic triggers.
